🛍️ People Counter and Gender Detection

This project is a **computer vision application** that counts the number of people entering a shopping mall and determines their **gender** (Male/Female).

It was designed to support **real-time analytics** using YOLOv8 and Python.

This project is the second project of my summer internship.
